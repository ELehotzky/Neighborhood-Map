**Houston Heights Neighborhood Sushi-Finder Map**
====================================
Udacity FEND Project 7

*About*
=======
-This is an app designed for residents of the Greater Houston Heights to search for nearby sushi restaurants. 

*Get Started*
=============
-After downloading the code, install and start with "npm install && npm start" in your terminal. The browser should open directly for you to the main page (http://localhost:3000). 

-Once you're in, the map will automatically center around the Houston Heights neighborhood. You can drag the map to scroll around and see different sushi restaurants, clicking on their map markers for an image and their name. 

-The Search box to the upper left-hand corner will allow you to filter through the restaurants by their name. It's dynamic, and will filter through the results as you type. If you find that you've typed something in and there's a result in the sidebar but you don't see a marker for it on the screen, you can click the entry in the sidebar and it will automatically pull the map and select that marker for you (give it a try by typing in "miyako").

-You can clear results by backspacing in the search venue box, or completely clear with the "x" that will appear to the right if there is any input in the box.
